This webpage is a “running training assistant.”
You can record your daily running distance, and the system will automatically calculate your recent training load. It helps you understand whether your current workload is too high, too low, or just right—so you can avoid injuries and train more effectively.

It also provides clothing suggestions based on weather, a pre-run checklist, and a monthly calendar that displays all your training records.
In short, it puts everything a runner usually needs in one place, so you don’t have to calculate or remember anything yourself. It makes running safer, easier, and more reassuring.
